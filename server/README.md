Hayward AquaLogic pool controller

There have been a few other implementations of "connect a server to your AquaLogic"; I wanted one which was a single piece of hardware (raspberry pi which could parse the protocol, store events in a database, and serve web pages).  Most of the protocol reverse-engineering has been done by others; I am standing on their shoulders as I make this.

A raspberry pi zero is not quite fast enough to reliably send the control signals without collision; I'm using a rpi 3+, along with a usb rs485 connector.

A REST api is generated/maintained by swagger; the api is present at

http://localhost:8080/docs

This project is still in its infancy.  Some features I intend to add are:

 - full REST api control of all pool devices
 - full REST api visibility into current status and information from the pool controller
 + streaming (socketIO) updates of events
 - logging of unrecognized messages to a specific location for study
 - web authentication and authorization
 - name mapping from generic (aux1, aux2, ...) to specific (yard lights, low-speed, etc.)
 + temperature visualization
 - notification (temperature ranges, freeze pump activation, no-flow during pump operation, etc.)
 - native ios application
 - basic web interface to control devices


To test using Docker on non-ARM:

docker build -f Dockerfile-osx -t rhbroberg/pool-controller-x64 .
docker-compose up -d
(optionally)
    docker push rhbroberg/pool-controller-x64


# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.


This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
